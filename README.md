# tftpread
Copyright Â© 2012 Bart Massey

This is a simple tftp reader client.  The tftpread program
accepts two command-line arguments: the hostname to fetch
from and the pathname to fetch. The program writes the
fetched file to stdout.

This client is intended as a network programming demo. As
such, it is not very robust or complete. Caveat emptor.

This program is licensed under the "MIT License".  Please
